# Conway's Game of Life 🌱

Welcome to my implementation of Conway's Game of Life! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dive into the fascinating world of cellular automata and watch how simple rules can create complex patterns.

## About the Game 🎮

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Rules of the Game 📜

The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The state of the grid evolves in discrete steps according to the following rules:

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
3. **Death by Isolation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
4. **Death by Overcrowding**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.

These simple rules lead to a rich variety of behaviors and patterns, some of which can be seen in the image above.
